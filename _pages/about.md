Gathoni’s gift is inspired by the story of the Hummingbird, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Professor Wangari Maathai a celebrated Kenyan environment activist. Wangari like our founders believed in triumphant courage within a very challenging world.

The story of the hummingbird is about this huge forest being consumed by a fire. All the animals in the forest come out and they are transfixed as they watch the forest burning and they feel very overwhelmed, very powerless, except this little hummingbird. It says, ‘I’m going to do something about the fire!’ So it flies to the nearest stream and takes a drop of water. It puts it on the fire, and goes up and down, up and down, up and down, as fast as it can.

In the meantime all the other animals, much bigger animals like the elephant with a big trunk that could bring much more water, they are standing there helpless. And they are saying to the hummingbird, ‘What do you think you can do? You are too little. This fire is too big. Your wings are too little and your beak is so small that you can only bring a small drop of water at a time.’

But as they continue to discourage it, it turns to them without wasting any time and it tells them, ‘I am doing the best I can.’

And that to me is what all of us should do. We should always be like a hummingbird. I may be insignificant, but I certainly don’t want to be like the animals watching the planet goes down the drain. I will be a hummingbird, I will do the best I can.

Today’s education deficit in Kenya is larger than before, since the establishment of free primary school education the institutions are in deplorable conditions weighed down by low funding and reduced participation by even poorer parents. 

Gathoni’s gift founders recognize the huge interventions needed for the entire sector overhaul, but are determined to pick a space from which to instigate change. Our pilot schools are our start, we will grow and hopefully inspire a similar movement from across Kenya. Because we choose to do something,  We chose to contribute…
